Serve files that are not Stored in public accessable Directories. e.g for Password Protected Areas. File links could and should not be shared!

The file links are decoded to hide the path from the user and to make the link only accessable for the current Session, so thats the reason why its not possible to share the links!

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later.

## Using ServeSecret

1. Crate a volume in craft (start with `@webroot` is recommended but it should work also with absolute paths

2. Use it in your templates --> put your asset as an method argument!


```twig
# the second parameter is optional, if is set to false, the file will download instead of open in the browser,the default value is true
<a href="{{ secretFile(entry.files.first(),false) }}">{{ entry.files.first().title }}</a>

{% for files in entry.files %}
       <a href="{{ secretFile(file,true) }}">{{ file.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}

```
